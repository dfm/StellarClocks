# StellarClocks

A repository for playing around with timing of normal stars:
Asteroseismic modes and exoplanets are very coherent oscillators.
These can be used (in principle) to make all the kinds of discoveries and measurements
that can be made with any other kinds of astronomical clocks (such as pulsars).
