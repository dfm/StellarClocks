\begin{abstract}
A significant fraction of stars have very short-period planets,
measurable at high signal-to-noise in \Kepler\ (or similar) data.
The periodic transit signal can be used like a clock, sensitive to
anomalous time delays generated by stellar motions.
In particular, they can be used to detect and characterize the
movement of a star in response to longer-period orbital companions,
including massive exoplanets.
Here we discuss the opportunities for using residuals in periodic
transit timing to discover and characterize long-period exoplanet
companions.
The residuals do not have the same character as what are known as
``transit-timing variations'', because they are not caused by
gravitational perturbations on the planet; they are caused by the
reflex displacement of the host star around the system barycenter
induced by the long-period planet's orbit.
We implement and demonstrate a method on real \Kepler\ data.  We find
that we can detect exoplanet-induced timing residuals with amplitudes
of $\sim XXX$~s in some typical systems with large, short-period
transiting planets (for context, Jupiter induces in-plane timing residuals in
the Sun with a semi-amplitude of 2.5~s).
We perform a rudimentary search in NNN systems and discover YYY
long-period exoplanet candidates.

\section{Introduction}

The very first extra-Solar planets (exoplanets) were discovered in
(millisecond?)\ pulsar system XXX (CITE).
They were discovered because the planet displacements relative to the
parent star (the pulsar) induce reaction displacements in that star;
these displacements lead to clock drifts or continuous timing
residuals in the arrival times of the pulses.
After these pulsar planets were discovered, large numbers of
exoplanets were discovered by the radial velocity (hereafter ``RV'') method (CITE).
These RV planets were discovered because the planet velocities induce
reaction velocities in the parent star; these velocities lead to
Doppler shifts in the stellar spectrum.
It is tempting to think of these kinds of discoveries as very similar
in kind, but they are somewhat different.
In particular, the timing-residual (hereafter ``TR'') method is
sensitive to \emph{displacements}, while the RV method is sensitive to
\emph{velocities}.

In some sense, the most analogous method to the TR method for finding
exoplanets is the as-yet unsuccessful astrometric-residual (hereafter
``AR'') method, in which an exoplanet can be found because its
displacement from the parent star induces a reaction displacement in
that star, detectable in a sensitive astrometric experiment.
The AR method has not yet delivered any exoplanet discoveries, but it
is expected to yield many planets once the \project{Gaia} satellite
begins delivering scientific data.
At fixed exoplanet mass, the TR and AR methods (in principle) have the
unique property that they increase in sensitivity with semi-major axis
or period:
Bigger displacements relative to the parent star lead to bigger
displacements of the parent star relative to the system barycenter.

Here we are going to propose looking for long-period exoplanets in the
\Kepler\ data, and \Kepler-like data, using the TR method.
The novel suggestion here is that short-period transiting exoplanets,
such as hot Jupiters, can be used as clocks.
The periodic transits provide a timing signal analogous to the pulsar
used in the pulsar TR discoveries.
Hot Jupiters are common (CITE) and it appears that long-period,
massive planets are also abundant, especially where there is a hot
Jupiter present (CITE).
These empirical results suggest that the TR method might yield many
new exoplanet discoveries.

Although this hot-planet TR (hereafter ``HPTR'') method is novel, it
is \emph{not} novel to look for exoplanets in timing data.
Indeed, many planets have been discovered or inferred by the method of
transit timing variations (TTV; for example CITE).
In the TTV method, planets are found or measured by looking at the
orbital phase, period, and inclination variations induced in a
transiting exoplanet by the gravitational perturbations on that planet
by another nearby (in orbital period), massive planet or companion.
That is, in the TTV method, new exoplanets are found or characterized by their
gravitational influence on the transiting planet.
In the HPTR method, we search for the signal created by an exoplanet's
gravitational influence on the host star.
This effect is smaller in amplitude---HPTR signals are measured in
seconds, whereas TTV signals are measured in minutes---but less
dependent on fortuitous exoplanetary system configuration.

...Hot Jupiters.  What do we know about abundance and coherence as
clocks?

...Time delay as a function of orbital phase.  Different from radial
velocity, similar to astrometric wobble.  Encodes as much information
about the orbit as the radial velocity, but with different units.

...Context of the Solar System and known Kepler and RV planets, especially long-period RV planets (accelerations).

\section{Signal generalities}

There are two qualitatively different methods for exoplanet discovery
via timing with a precise stellar ``clock''.
The first is to look at the ``clock rate'' and see that the clock runs
faster as it approaches us, and slower as it recedes.
This is very similar, in some sense, to the radial-velocity method for
finding exoplanets; it is more sensitive to planets that induce larger
reaction velocities in the parent star, because clock rate changes are
driven by Doppler shifts.
If all that is used is the \emph{rate} of the clock, not all of the
information available is being exploited, because a precise clock has
phase coherence over the time of the experiment.

The second method captures that phase coherence.
It is to look at the timing residuals and see that the clock ``ticks''
are retarded (relative to a purely periodic signal) when the clock is
farther from us and advanced when the clock is closer.
This method is more sensitive to planets that induce larger reaction
\emph{displacements} in the parent star.
This latter method---timing residuals---is going to be more sensitive
in general, because it makes use of not just the frequency information
(the clock rate) but also the phase information (the coherent,
predictable arrival times of the transits).
It is also more sensitive to the larger-period planets, which are hard
to find by other methods.
For these reasons, we use the timing-residuals method in what follows.

In the method (below), we will find the signals by building a
generative model of the full data stream; that is, we won't measure
individual transit times explicitly.
However, in this \sectionname, just for discussion purposes, let's
imagine measuring a set of transit arrival times, that may have been
distorted by a time-dependent displacement of the parent star.  What
can be measured from such a signal, and how precisely can it be
measured?
The precision will depend on the properties of the star and the
observing program; here we estimate precision for the
\Kepler\ mission, but the analysis is generalizable.

If a typical hot-Jupiter transit in a typical star observed by
\Kepler\ lasts hours and is measured with a signal-to-noise of
thousands, then we might hope to be able to measure the time of that
transit (that clock ``tick'') to a precision $\delta t_\tick\sim
10$~s, depending in detail on the shape of the transit, the cadence of
the data, and the properties of the relevant noise sources (some of
which are intrinsic to the star).
A hot Jupiter might transit a hundred times $N_\tick\sim 100$ or
several hundred times in the duration of the \Kepler\ mission, so the
overall precision with which the equivalent, periodic clock could be
synchronized is potentially better than
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta t &\sim& \frac{\delta t_\tick}{\sqrt{N_\tick}}
\\
\delta t &\sim& 1~\mathrm{s}
\quad .
\end{eqnarray}
This sets the rough precision of a hot-Jupiter clock in \Kepler:
It should be useful for detecting exoplanet-induced timing drifts or
variations that have amplitudes substantially larger than 1~s within
the \Kepler\ mission.
For context, in the Solar System, Jupiter induces in-plane timing
residuals in the Sun with a semi-amplitude of 2.5~s.
This also illustrates that clocks with shorter periods (higher
$N_\tick$ in the mission lifetime) or sharper or louder ``ticks''
(smaller $\delta t_\tick$) are more valuable.

Of course this is naive in several respects: The first is that the
timing residuals induced by an outer exoplanet are varying
non-trivially with time; it should be easier to find signals that have
a period comparable to (or shorter than) the \Kepler\ mission
lifetime.
That is, the $\delta t$ precision is only an order-of-magnitude
estimate; it will be modified by the functional form of the timing
distortion we seek.
The second is that very long-period signals, even if they have large
amplitude, will only be detectable as clock drifts if they show
\emph{acceleration} (second derivative of displacement with time)
inside the \Kepler\ mission window (otherwise their effects are
equivalent to a non-varying period offset in the clock rate).
Just as with radial-velocity exoplanet discovery; in the limit of
large periods, it is only accelerations that are measureable.

...fix next paragraphs to flow

If you can measure the timing amplitude $T_0$, you get a measure of
the line-of-sight semi-major axis projection $a\,\sin i$.
The amplitude $T_0$ rises linearly with the separation $a$ between the
planet and star, just like the astrometric wobble amplitude.
If you can \emph{also} measure the astrometric amplitude $\theta_0$,
you get the distance.
The proper-motion distance, to be very specific.
If you measure the timing amplitude $T_0$ and also transits, the
inclination is usually very highly constrained and $a\,\sin i$ becomes
a complete measurement of $a$.
(If you can also measure the radial velocity and period, you get a
measure of the speed of light.)

In principle, the one-dimensional projection (onto the line of sight)
of the full Keplerian eccentric orbit shape is encoded in the time
history, so in principle we can measure the eccentricity and
orientation of the argument of perihelion.
Indeed, the time-delay function of time is just the integral of the
radial velocity function of time; anything that can be inferred from
radial-velocity data can be inferred from time-delay data.
That said, the sensitivities to noise will be different, and good
inferences will require very good time-delay data.
